If you wish to contribute to development of Hypersomnia, you must firstly properly clone it from our <a class="vsenum" href="https://github.com/TeamHypersomnia/Hypersomnia"><span class="vsparam">[</span>official repository here<span class="vsparam">]</span></a> (includes assets).<br/>
<br/>
Go to the directory where you wish to have your <span class="vsenum">Hypersomnia</span> project downloaded,<br/>
open git bash and paste:<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color:white">git clone https://github.com/TeamHypersomnia/Hypersomnia.git --recursive</span>
<br/>
<br/>
The repository will start downloading.
Once complete, open <span class="vsenum">Hypersomnia.sln</span> file, select <span class="vsenum">Release x86</span> configuration and hit F7 to build.<br/>
<br/>
As it currently stands, the project is not ported to any other platform.<br/>
<br/>
If you dream about creating an entirely new mechanic, I recommend that you be familiar with <a class ="vsenum" href="http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/31473/what-is-the-role-of-systems-in-a-component-based-entity-
architecture"><span class="vsparam">[</span>component-based entity architecture<span class="vsparam">]</span></a> beforehand.<br/> Better yet, tell me about your plans! Together we can deal with problems more swiftly.
