The game will now perform a very busy first launch, wherein it will procedurally regenerate:<br/>
<div style="margin-left:3em"><br/>
- <span class="vstype">buttons with corners</span> used for hotbar and menu buttons<br/>
- <span class="vstype">desaturations</span> requested for some textures<br/>
- all <span class="vstype">neon maps</span> - I won't have to blur all the images by hand anymore - the game will do it on its own!<br/>
This also means that the neon images will be more consistent.<br/>
- detailed <span class="vstype">polygonizations</span> of images needed for better accuracy of physical shapes<br/>
- <span class="vstype">HUD circles</span> like health bars<br/>
- <span class="vstype">fonts</span> from .ttf files<br/>
- <span class="vstype">atlases</span> for all of the above.<br/> Like this:<br/>
<br/>
<img src="{{ site.img2_dir }}53.game_atlas.png"/><br/>
<br/>
The console log then looks like this:<br/>
<br/>
<img src="{{ site.img2_dir }}51.content_regeneration.png"/><br/>
<br/>
</div>

It's almost as if my game became more lively in a single moment!<br/>
This only happens once though as on every subsequent launch, the game has all the baked atlases and other resources ready to be loaded straight away.<br/>
The regenerators also output <span class="vsenum">.stamp</span> files which contain copy of the inputs gathered from configs</br>
along with the last write time of the source image, should one exist:<br/>
<br/>
<img src="{{ site.img2_dir }}55.regenerators.png"/><br/>
</br>
This way, the regenerators know exactly which resources are to be created again due to a change in config or in a source image.<br/>
</br>
Needless to say, all of this drastically reduces the time needed to launch the application,<br/>
by my measurements at least by <span class="vsnumber">150 </span>ms - which is quite a number considering<br/>
that it was already starting up in a fraction of a second.<br/>
<br/>
My game was also accepted to the very front page of the <a style="color:white" href="https://www.gamedev.pl/"><span class="vsparam">[</span>gamedev.pl<span class="vsparam">]</span></a>,<br/>
where I've posted a description of the game, this time in Polish.<br/>
