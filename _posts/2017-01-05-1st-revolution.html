There are so many new things that I need to split this article into several sections.<br/>
Here is what I did over the course of these three silent months:<br/>

<div class="separator" id="section1"></div>
<span style="color:white">Inventory GUI refactored and fully networked</span><br/>
<br/>
The inventory GUI has undergone an architectural revolution and is now a part of the networked simulation.<br/>
Thanks to template metaprogramming magic, item and slot buttons are completely devoid of pointers.<br/>
Each part of the game GUI gets transferred over the network as a piece of linear memory.<br/>
You can wield a rifle, attach a suppressor and drop it back for your friend to pick up.<br/>
Now I could even implement sharing inventory view between players with little effort.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="separator" id="section2"></div>
<span style="color:white">Introduction of pixel-art lighting, this time with neon maps</span><br/>
<br/>
I have introduced lighting system stylized specifically for pixel art:<br/>
<br/>
<img src="{{ site.img2_dir }}23.light.png"/><br/>
<br/>
To cast shadows, I use the same 2D visibility system that I have coded for improvised AI pathfinding.
<br/>
Items themselves can glow in the darkness:<br/>
<br/>
<img src="{{ site.img2_dir }}24.light.png"/><br/>
<br/>
This is thanks to so called "neon maps".<br/>
For each sprite that I want to emanate light, I create a special image called "sprite_name_neon_map.png".<br/>
The game detects existence of such a file and associates it with the sprite called "sprite_name".<br/>
For example, a proper "backpack_neon_map.png" for the above glowing backpack looks like this:<br/>
<br/>
<img src="{{ site.img2_dir }}26.neon.png"/><br/>
<br/>
Walls (occluders) are illuminated, too, albeit with a stronger attenuation so that they stand out:<br/>
<br/>
<img src="{{ site.img2_dir }}25.light.png"/><br/>
<br/>
You can notice the differing attenuation because the light circles are not continuous across the ground and the wall.<br/>
<br/>
To summarize, here's the process of creating the lightmap texture with 4 dynamic lights:<br/>
<br/>
<img src="{{ site.img2_dir }}27.passes.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
Firstly, the framebuffer is cleared with <span style="color:white">(0.1f, 0.2f, 0.2f, 1.0f)</span> in order to generate some cool, cyan ambient lighting.<br/>
Secondly, I render all lights as triangles that represent the unshadowed region.<br/>
In the last frame of the above animation, I render the neon maps on top of all rendered lights without caring about shadows at all.<br/>
It's important to do all this with <span class="vsmacro">glBlendFuncSeparate(GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE, GL_ONE, GL_ONE)</span> and thence additively,</br>
instead of the standard <span class="vsmacro">glBlendFuncSeparate(GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE, GL_ONE)</span></span>.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, in order to render all geometry with proper illumination, I use this fragment shader:<br/>
<br/>
{% highlight glsl %}
	#version 330

	smooth in vec4 theColor;
	in vec2 theTexcoord;
	
	out vec4 outputColor;
	
	uniform sampler2D basic_texture;
	uniform sampler2D light_texture; // generated lightmap
	
	const int light_levels = 3;
	const int light_step = 255/light_levels;
	
	void main() 
	{
		vec2 texcoord = gl_FragCoord.xy;
		texcoord.x /= textureSize(light_texture, 0).x; 
		texcoord.y /= textureSize(light_texture, 0).y;
	
		vec4 light = texture(light_texture, texcoord);
	
		float intensity = max(max(light.r, light.g), light.b);
		intensity = float(
			
			light_step * (int(intensity * 255.0) / light_step + light_levels)
	
			) / 255.0;
		light.rgb *= intensity;
	
		vec4 pixel = theColor * texture(basic_texture, theTexcoord) * light;
		outputColor = pixel;
	}
{% endhighlight %}<br/>
<br/>
Notice that I clamp the light's intensity to a small number of levels to achieve their pixely look.<br/>
I however leave the hue intact, so that the colors themselves transition smoothly.<br/>
Resulting in this:<br/>
<br/>
<img src="{{ site.img2_dir }}28.scene.png"/><br/>
<br/>
<div class="separator" id="section3"></div>
<span style="color:white">Introduction of tilesets and their specular highlights</span><br/>
<br/>
You could already see that in the above image: tilesets are back!<br/>
You can also notice some neat specular blinks on top of the shiny kind of tiles.<br/>
They are however absent under insufficient luminance:<br/>
<br/>
<img src="{{ site.img2_dir }}29.highlights.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
That is because I use a specialized version of the above shader to render the specular highlights:<br/>
<br/>
{% highlight glsl %}
	#version 330
	smooth in vec4 theColor;
	in vec2 theTexcoord;
	
	out vec4 outputColor;
	
	uniform sampler2D basic_texture;
	uniform sampler2D light_texture;
	
	const int light_levels = 3;
	const int light_step = 255/light_levels;
	
	void main() 
	{
		vec2 texcoord = gl_FragCoord.xy;
		texcoord.x /= textureSize(light_texture, 0).x; 
		texcoord.y /= textureSize(light_texture, 0).y;
	
		vec4 light = texture(light_texture, texcoord);
	
		float intensity = max(max(light.r, light.g), light.b);
		
		int level = (int(intensity * 255.0) / light_step + light_levels);
	
		if(level < 4)
			discard;
	
		intensity = float(
			
			light_step * (level + 3)
	
			) / 255.0;
		light.rgb *= intensity;
	
		vec4 pixel = theColor * texture(basic_texture, theTexcoord) * light;
		outputColor = pixel;
	}
{% endhighlight %}<br/>
<br/>
It only differs from the previous shader by that I discard the fragment if the light intensity is not enough.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="separator" id="section4"></div>
<span style="color:white">Introduction of pixel-art smoke and reactivation of all particle systems</span><br/>
<br/>
After reactivating the particle systems, I have decided to implement some smokes for esthetics:<br/>
<br/>
<img src="{{ site.img2_dir }}30.smoke.png"/><br/>
<span class="vsparam">(HUD on that old screen is a bit bigger than normal)</span><br/>
<br/>
Notice that the smoke has as little as only two intensity levels, once again to give it a pixely feel.<br/>
How it's done: I dedicate a separate framebuffer for rendering smoke particles, create a texture out of the end result,<br/>
and finally render that texture as a fullscreen overlay with a dedicated shader that clamps the alpha to an intensity level between 0, 1 and 2.<br/>
In that regard, it is handled somewhat similarly to light.<br/>
There is however a little bit more of magic involved. Once intensity of the smoke is calculated, I change its hue to that of the light in that location.<br/>
I must therefore use the generated lightmap texture to properly illuminate the smokes, too.<br/>
<br/>
So, to render the smoke particles to the framebuffer, I use a standard shader used by all other geometry,
but I once again set <span class="vsmacro">glBlendFuncSeparate(GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE, GL_ONE, GL_ONE)</span> for that stage.<br/>
The shader for the fullscreen overlay however, looks like this:<br/>
<br/>
{% highlight glsl %}
	#version 330
	in vec2 theTexcoord;
	out vec4 outputColor;
	
	uniform sampler2D smoke_texture;
	uniform sampler2D light_texture;
	
	const int smoke_levels = 3;
	const int smoke_step = 255/smoke_levels;
	const int light_levels = 3;
	const int light_step = 255/light_levels;
	
	vec3 rgb2hsv(vec3 c)
	{
	    vec4 K = vec4(0.0, -1.0 / 3.0, 2.0 / 3.0, -1.0);
	    vec4 p = mix(vec4(c.bg, K.wz), vec4(c.gb, K.xy), step(c.b, c.g));
	    vec4 q = mix(vec4(p.xyw, c.r), vec4(c.r, p.yzx), step(p.x, c.r));
	
	    float d = q.x - min(q.w, q.y);
	    float e = 1.0e-10;
	    return vec3(abs(q.z + (q.w - q.y) / (6.0 * d + e)), d / (q.x + e), q.x);
	}
	
	vec3 hsv2rgb(vec3 c)
	{
	    vec4 K = vec4(1.0, 2.0 / 3.0, 1.0 / 3.0, 3.0);
	    vec3 p = abs(fract(c.xxx + K.xyz) * 6.0 - K.www);
	    return c.z * mix(K.xxx, clamp(p - K.xxx, 0.0, 1.0), c.y);
	}
	
	void main() 
	{	
		vec4 smoke = texture(smoke_texture, theTexcoord);
	
		float smoke_intensity = smoke.a;//max(max(smoke.r, smoke.g), smoke.b);
		int smoke_step_number = (int(smoke_intensity * 255.0) / smoke_step);
	
		if(smoke_step_number <= 1)
			discard;
			//else
			//smoke_step_number = 2;
	
		smoke_intensity = float(
			
			smoke_step * smoke_step_number
	
			) / 255.0;
	
		{
			vec3 smoke_hsv = rgb2hsv(smoke.rgb);
			vec3 colorful_smoke = hsv2rgb(vec3(smoke_hsv.x, smoke_hsv.y, 1.0));
		
			smoke.a = smoke_intensity * 0.3;
			smoke.rgb = colorful_smoke;
		}
	
		{
			vec2 texcoord = gl_FragCoord.xy;
			texcoord.x /= textureSize(light_texture, 0).x; 
			texcoord.y /= textureSize(light_texture, 0).y;
		
			vec4 light = texture(light_texture, texcoord);
		
			float light_intensity = max(max(light.r, light.g), light.b);
			light_intensity = float(
				
				light_step * (int(light_intensity * 255.0) / light_step + light_levels)
		
				) / 255.0;
			light.rgb *= light_intensity;
	
			smoke *= light;
		}
	
		outputColor = smoke;
	}

<br/>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/28/OpenAL_logo.png/200px-OpenAL_logo.png"/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have successfully integrated 
<a style="color:white" class="vstext" href="http://kcat.strangesoft.net/openal.html"><span class="vsparam">[</span>OpenAL Soft<span class="vsparam">]</span></a> source code into my project.<br/>
You can already hear some decent sound effects for:<br/>
shooting, driving, getting hit by a bullet, bullet passing through a held item, bullet hitting an obstacle, character's death and buttons in the main menu.<br/>
Apart from properly spatializing the sound via <span class="vstype">Head-Related Transfer Function</span>, I've also enabled <span class="vstype">doppler effect</span><br/>
and added some simple air absorption through <span class="vstype">EFX extensions</span>, proportionally to the distance from the sound source.<br/>
<br/>
For example, listen to these passing cars:<br/>
<br/>
<video id="14.Slowmotion-aimpunch" src="{{ site.img_dir }}31.passing_cars.webm" controls></video><br/>
<br/>Or such a firefight:<br/>
<br/>
<video id="14.Slowmotion-aimpunch" src="{{ site.img_dir }}32.firefight.webm" controls></video><br/>
<br/>
For now I am using some sample sounds from public domain found on <a style="color:white" class="vstext" href="http://freesound.org/"><span class="vsparam">[</span>freesound.org.<span class="vsparam">]</span></a>

<br/>
You might ask: how was I able to coordinate that many entities having not enough friends for that, <br/>and without any kind of artificial intelligence?<br/>
The answer - a new launch mode, "DIRECTOR" mode!<br/>
<br/>
<img src="{{ site.img2_dir }}32.director.png"/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have implemented a novel launch mode wherein I can deterministically rewind and replay the universe at will,<br/> 
and also change the controlled character at any moment.<br/>
For example, here's how I'd record a simple motorcycle chase scene:<br/>
<br/>
<img src="{{ site.img2_dir }}33.director.gif"/>
<br/>
<br/>
What happens here:<br/>
Firstly, the universe is paused and I choose the truck character.<br/> 
Secondly, I choose recording mode, of which the GUI notifies me.<br/>
Thirdly, I steer the truck for a while and once I'm done I press pause button.<br/>
I save the changes and choose replaying mode.<br/>
Then, I rewind the universe to the moment where the truck was still motionless, and choose the motorcycle character.<br/> 
Once again I choose recording mode, of which the GUI notifies me.<br/>
This time I steer the motocyclist and the director mode combines the inputs of both characters to create a "performance".<br/>
I can do it with as many characters as I want.<br/>
<br/>
Once I'm done and have a satisfactory scene, I can simply save the resultant demo to a file and load and replay it later.<br/>
That is how I created the entire intro scene for the main menu background.<br/>
<br/>

<div class="separator" id="section7"></div>
<span style="color:white">New content: JMIX114 motorcycle, better truck, KEK9, BILMER2000</span><br/>
<br/>
My internet friend has drawn me several new game objects. Some of them include: <br/><br/>
<img src="{{ site.img2_dir }}truck_inside.png"/>
<img src="{{ site.img2_dir }}jmix114.png"/>
<img src="{{ site.img2_dir }}bilmer2000.png"/>
<img src="{{ site.img2_dir }}kek9.png"/><br/>
<br/>
You have already seen them all in action in the above pictures, animations and webms.<br/>
From left to right: better military truck interior, JMIX114 heavily armored motorcycle, BILMER2000 assault rifle and a KEK9 pistol.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="separator" id="section8"></div>
<span style="color:white">Experimental test server widget on Hypersomnia homepage showing online players</span><br/>
<br/>
I have implemented a live widget on my blog to track the status of the official Hypersomnia server.<br/>
For the moment the "server" just runs from my computer like this:<br/>
<br/>
<img src="{{ site.img2_dir }}2017-01-05_20-56-51.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
The widget also tells you when was the last time I launched the server.<br/>
Ultimately I will buy VPS in a not so distant future, but obviously, when I am online like that and testing the server,<br/>
you are free to join with your client and meet me in my experimental universe.<br/>
You just need to paste 
<span style="color:white">universe.hypersomnia.pl</span> into your config.lua file as the connect address,<br/>
which always points to the internet address of my personal computer (and my only and beloved workstation, at that).<br/>
<br/>
<div class="separator" id="section9"></div>
<span style="color:white">Fixed build problems and can now build Hypersomnia with just one click</span><br/>
<br/>
Last but not least, I have fixed some serious problems with submodules in my repository.<br/>
Now you can simply clone the whole repository with just a single command and then hit F7 in Visual Studio.<br/>
The project will build in its entirety, along with OpenAL sources. Simple as that.<br/>
Proper instructions can, as always, be found here:<br/>
<br/>
<a style="color:white" class="vstext" href="http://hypersomnia.pl/join/"><span class="vsparam">[</span>http://hypersomnia.pl/join/<span class="vsparam">]</span></a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="separator" id="section9"></div>
<br/>
That would be it about revolutions!<br/>
I am seriously glad if you have read that all - perhaps you are among the elite.<br/>
<br/>
I will now be working on <span class="vstype">Deus Ex</span> inspired hotbar for items and weapons.<br/>
And I will try to write more often.<br/>
Stay tuned!
