GUI now supports grabbing arbitrary amounts of items using mouse wheel.<br/>
You can now compose rifle magazines freely with a mixture of colors of your choice.<br/>
<br/>
When closed, magazines count bullets inside, but when open, they print how much space is left.<br/>
Did some minor glitch fixing, too.<br/><br/>
Next will be something special - a <span class="vskeyword">Deus Ex</span>-like HUD that highlights items in focus (hovered by mouse in this case).<br/><br/>
<img src="{{ site.img_dir }}4.Stacking.gif"/>
<div class="spacer"></div>
<br/>
Our <a class="vskeyword" href="{{ "/ts3"| prepend: site.baseurl }}">TeamSpeak page</a> now features a full-blown widget with channels and online users!<br/>
