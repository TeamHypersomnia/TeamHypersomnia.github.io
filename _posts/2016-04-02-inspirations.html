I won't lie.<br/>
These ideas of mine are not entirely unrepeated.<br>
<br/>
<a class="vsstring" href="http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/a/1660/16982">"Game design is pretty much one giant incestuous ball of borrowing, and, honestly, is better for it."</a><br/>
<br/>
Could not agree more.<br/>
After all, fabrication of new games is just propagation of schemata, inheritance of characteristics of one generation by the next,<br/>
for as natural selection evaluates living entities, so shall our minds breed what cherishes them most.<br/>
<br/>
Consequently, I nominate several productions that I truly hold dear for the following reasons:<br/>
<ul>
<li><a class="vsenum" href="http://www.hotlinemiami.com/">Hotline Miami</a> for its insane <span class="vskeyword">pace</span> and due recognition of one's skill;</li>
<li><a class="vsenum" href="https://www.deusex.com/">Deus Ex</a> <span class="vsparam">(the first one particularly)</span> for its wonderful <span class="vskeyword">city vibes</span>, splendid pixely <span class="vskeyword">HUD</span> and open-mindedness about <span class="vskeyword">solutions to problems</span>;</li>
<li><a class="vsenum" href="http://tibia.com">Tibia</a> for how it made people actually <span class="vskeyword">fear death in a video game</span> <span class="vsparam">(Many years ago, I got killed in this game, cried bitterly and remained restless for the rest of the day)</span> <br/> and for how it is <span class="vsparam">(or at least used to be)</span> community-centered.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
These are elements I find utterly important to my plan.<br/>
All these combined constitute a game that I would play tirelessly until the very end of my days,<br/>
and possibility of that is what keeps me in pursuance of The Hypersomnia Project.<br/>
<br/>
I'm gonna get some sleep and work hard on the inventory system tomorrow afternoon.
