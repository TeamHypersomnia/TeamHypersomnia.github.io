From now on, I will be versioning the official to-do list of the project.<br/>
It's located here:<br/>
<br/>
<a class="vsenum" href="https://github.com/geneotech/Augmentations/tree/master/ToDo">https://github.com/geneotech/Augmentations/tree/master/ToDo</a><br/>
<br/>
From this you can learn about my plans in more detail,<br/>
however the technical entries are a mess - they aren't exactly designed to be understood by anybody else because these are mostly just quick notes for my own use.<br/>
If somebody joins for real, I will make every single word of it understandable.<br/>
<br/>
If you're interested, you can still read the <span class="vskeyword">GDD section</span> which is mostly ideas and concepts!<br/>
Remember though it is still a subject to change and many features are not yet completely described and/or properly planned.<br/>
That's because first of all, I'm focusing on coding a fun game!<br/>
<br/>
To open the list, you need to download <a class="vsenum" href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5371/ToDoList-An-effective-and-flexible-way-to-keep-on">this awesome open-source program</a>.<br/>
A quick glance:<br/><br/>
