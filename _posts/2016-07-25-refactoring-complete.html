After two months of intense labour, I have finally launched Hypersomnia again!<br/>
<br/>
Throughout this seemingly neverending treatment, the following has been achieved:
<br/>
<ul>
<li>Made significant state of the simulation <span style="font-style: italic;">devoid of</span> <span class="vstype">pointers and references</span><span class="vsparam"> (except containers)</span>, enabling trivial duplication and serialization.</li>
<li>Provided <span class="vstype">constness guarantees</span> for access to entities and components, ensuring that the model stays unalterable during rendering-time, further enforcing <span class="vstype">determinism of the simulation</span>.</li>
<li>The concerns of an <span class="vstype">entity</span> and <span class="vstype">definition</span> thereof were gracefully disentangled owing to my paradigm.</li>
<li>Practically the whole entity-component-system became type-safe (on the fundamental level).</li>
<li>I learned a whole lot of metaprogramming which may or may not be considered an advantage.</li>
<li class="vsparam">Unfortunately, GUI is only partially refactored. Static polymorphism turns out to be a handful, so GUI is temporarily disabled. I will come back later to it.</li>
</ul>
<!--more-->
The approaches I follow are most of the time experimental; whether it will backfire in some distant future I may not know.<br>
Still, the underlying concepts are so orderly that I am destined to once write a treatise thereupon.<br/>
One may find my dedication unreasoning, but I follow these principles primarily in hopes that they work in favour of knowledge of all.<br/>

<span style="font-size:21px">I shall also announce that <span class="vsenum">Linux port of Hypersomnia</span> is on the way!<br/></span>
<br/>
My dear high school friend <a class="vsenum" href="https://github.com/ArcCha"><span class="vsparam">[</span>Adam<span class="vsparam">]</span></a>, who happens to be a profound enthusiast of the OS, has bravely undertaken this task of migration.<br/>
He delved promptly into my inscrutable codebase and flicked through semantics recondite to say the least;<br/>
as a result, around half of the framework compiles successfully with GCC.<br/>
<br/>
I plan to support both the server and the client on Windows and Linux systems.

Last but not least, I can already save and load the entire game state!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<span class="vsparam" style="font-style: italic;">(Profiler view enabled)</span><br/>
<br/>
I did some testing and it occurs that loading a <span class="vsnumber">52 MB</span> universe takes around <span class="vsnumber">0.64s</span>,<br/>
whereas saving it can be as fast as <span class="vsnumber">0.25s</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, duplication of the entire cosmos is a trivial operation in the new architecture: it is not even a serialization/deserialization cycle.<br/>
This is important for <span class="vstype">frequent backups</span> server-side, for <span class="vstype">delta compression</span> and for <span class="vstype">client-side prediction</span>.<br/>
All of these mechanisms need to maintain a single or multiple copies of the cosmos, perhaphs for further manipulation.<br/>
<br/>
Since serialization is up and running, I may now revisit the world of networking.<br/>
<br/>
<a class="vsenum" href="https://github.com/TeamHypersomnia/Augmentations/tree/master/3rdparty"><span class="vsparam">[</span>Some of the 3rdparties changed!<span class="vsparam">]</span></a><br/>I made heavy use of Git Submodules to properly link the repos and now the project compiles from scratch using no prebuilt libraries.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vsparam" style="font-style: italic;">We Carried An Entire Universe Across A Bridge Tonight.</span><br/>
Stay tuned for more.
