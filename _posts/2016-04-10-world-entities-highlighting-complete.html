It's done! As promised, highlighting of objects inspired by <span class="vskeyword">Deus Ex</span>:<br/>
<br/>
<img src="{{ site.img_dir }}6.World entities highlighting.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
It respects the rendering order; any stacking of truck trailers in particular.<br/>
I will use the mechanism for targeting or something alike, maybe selecting objects I intend to pick up,<br/>
or maybe even opening some context menus with actions available for given object.<br/>
<br/>
It will sure come in handy once I introduce map creation mode.
