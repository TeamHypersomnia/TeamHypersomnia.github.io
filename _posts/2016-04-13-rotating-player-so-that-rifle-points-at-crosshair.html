At some point, you might want to attach a rifle to your top-down hero.<br/>
And, you might want to <span class="vskeyword">shoot it</span>.</br>
<br/>
My game involves a crosshair that determines the player body's rotation around its <span class="vskeyword">origin</span>.<br/>
The body's <span class="vskeyword">origin</span> is the center of the character's head <span class="vstype">O</span>.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vsenum">In other words, the player's head always looks at the crosshair.</span><br/>
<br/>
The body may have several fixtures which necessarily rotate therewith, for example a gun attached to the primary hand.<br/>
As such, the crosshair is used to properly direct every gunshot.<br/>
<br/>
Let us define the rifle's center as <span class="vstype">A</span>, the rifle's barrel as <span class="vstype">B</span> and your player's head center as <span class="vstype">O</span>.<br/>
I assume here that each launched bullet follows the ray defined by <span class="vstype">AB</span>.<br/>
Now, everything's all and well if <span class="vstype">O, A, B</span> are colinear.
This is especially true if you position your gun like this:<br/><br/>
<img src="{{ site.img_dir }}head_gun.png"/><br/><br/>
So if your head looks at the crosshair, so does the rifle and its barrel.</span><br/>
But we're not always this lucky, especially if you're after gangsta-pistol layout: <br/><br/>
<img src="{{ site.img_dir }}head_pistol.png"/><br/>
<br/>
It becomes obvious that if the gun is to look exactly at crosshair, your character's eyes certainly cannot so.<br/>
They need to be directed somewhere a little bit different,<br/>
in the picture above for example, you'd need to tilt the whole character's body a tiny bit counter-clockwise.<br/>
<br/>
Let us express the problem in mathematical terms - given are points:<br/>
<span class="vstype">O<span class="vsparam"> (head)</span>, A <span class="vsparam"> (rifle center)</span>, B <span class="vsparam"> (barrel)</span>, C <span class="vsparam"> (crosshair)</span>.</span><br/>
Let us define a <span class="vskeyword">circle</span> whose center is at <span class="vstype">O</span class="vstype"> and whose radius is <span class="vstype">OB</span class="vstype">.<br/>
These conditions follow:<br/>
1. <span class="vstype">A</span> lies inside the <span class="vskeyword">circle</span>.<br/>
2. <span class="vstype">C</span> lies outside the <span class="vskeyword">circle</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Notice that <span class="vstype">B</span> lies on the <span class="vskeyword">circle</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The question becomes:<br/>
<span class="vsenum">By what angle should we rotate <span class ="vsparam">(around the center of rotation O)</span> points A and B in order to make A, B and C colinear?</span></br>
<br/>
Well, I'm not particularly good at geometry but fortunately, Marcel, a friend of mine, came to the rescue!<br/>
It took him no more than 15 minutes of scribbling with his compass to come up with a solution:<br/><br/>
1. Consider a circle <span class="vstype">Y</span> whose center is at <span class="vstype">O</span class="vstype"> and whose radius is <span class="vstype">OC</span>.<br/>
2. Let <span class="vstype">G</span class="vstype"> be the point of intersection of <span class="vstype">Y</span> and a ray <span class="vstype">BA</span>.<br/>
3. The angle we're looking for is twice the angle <span class="vstype">CGA</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Without really trying to validate his mysterious recommendation, I went on to code the damn thing.<br/>
And guess what, it works flawlessly!<br/>
This is how these hardcore calculations look like in debug drawing mode:<br/><br/>

<br/>
Legend:<br/>
<span style="color: yellow">OG</span><br/>
<span style="color: red">Input A, B and properly rotated A, B</span><br/>
<span style="color: white">line going through the points A, B, C</span><br/>
<span style="color: green">angle CGA</span><br/>
<span style="color: cyan">OC</span><br/>
<br/>
Very well. So, from now on, you can shoot your gun with pinpoint accuracy.<br/><br/>

<span class="vsparam">I've already got a working recoil prototype, so the bullet is not exactly on the barrel-crosshair line due to crosshair's displacement after the shot.</span><br/><br/>
