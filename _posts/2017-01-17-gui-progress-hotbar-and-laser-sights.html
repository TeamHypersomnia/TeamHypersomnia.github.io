I have coded some brand-new elements of <span class="vstype">GUI</span>.<br/>
You can now accurately inspect trajectory of your projectile with this nicely glowing <span class="vstype">laser</span>:<br/>
<br/>
<img src="{{ site.img2_dir }}34.laser.png"/>

<br/>
<br/>
The laser changes its appearance with regard to hostility of the targeted party.<br/>
<br/>
It can turn green when pointing at an ally:<br/>
<br/>
<img src="{{ site.img2_dir }}35.laser_friendly.gif"/>
<br/>
<br/>
Or it can turn red when pointing at a foe:
<br/>
<br/>
<img src="{{ site.img2_dir }}36.laser_enemy.gif"/>
<br/>
<br/>
The laser also appears as a dashed line beyond the first physical obstacle.
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="separator"></div>
Furthermore, I have programmed a <span class="vstype">Deus Ex</span>-inspired hotbar used to quickly draw weapons and other items.<br/>
Whilst picking up items, hotbar will automatically populate with shortcuts. Currently wielded items are highlighted with full border.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="{{ site.img2_dir }}37.hotbar_picking_up.gif"/>
<br/>
<br/>
I can press <span class="vsenum">Q</span> to quickly draw the previously wielded weapon.<br/>
Dual wields are also possible. Just press two buttons without releasing either and you have a dual wield:<br/>
<br/>
<img src="{{ site.img2_dir }}38.hotbar_dual_wields.gif"/>
<br/>
<br/>
If a dual wielding setup is selected after another dual wielding setup, <br/><span class="vsenum">Q</span> will correctly switch between dual wields, instead
of just single weapons.<br/>
When dual wielding, the hotbar button whose assigned item resides in the secondary hand will have a paler color (it's configurable).<br/>
<br/>
Drag and drop is also fully functional within the hotbar, one can easily assign the items to slots, reassign them and clear assignments altogether:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Hints describing the imminent action are provided 
- <span class="vsstring">Assign</span>, 
<span class="vsstring">Reassign</span>, 
<span class="vsstring">Clear assignment</span>.
<br/><br/>
<div class="separator"></div>
That's it about recent progress.<br/>
<br/>
I will be now working on a little something that will work as mana, in my universe properly called <span class="vstype">Personal Electricity</span>, and then code some test damage and healing spells.<br/>
