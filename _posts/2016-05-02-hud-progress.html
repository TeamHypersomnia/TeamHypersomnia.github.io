On to the next account of progress.<br/>
<br/>
I've implemented a working prototype of <span class="vstype">sentience system</span>.<br/>
A <span class="vstype">sentient entity</span> is that which may receive <span class="vskeyword">damage</span> from a hostile force;<br/>
if its <span class="vskeyword">health value</span> drops to <span class="vsnumber">zero</span> or less, it dies necessarily.<br/>
<br/>
I also thought that, at this point, it'd be nice to draw the current <span class="vskeyword">health value</span> of each <span class="vstype">sentient being</span>, close to where it is currently drawn in the game world.<br/>
Great - how am I going to position a rectangular bar sprite along a possibly rotating object,<br/>
while still being able to tell which one belongs to whom (especially in a crowded area)?<br/>
<span class="vsenum">The answer: circular HUD to the rescue!</span><br/>
<br/>
<img src="{{ site.img_dir }}11.Healing.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
Since its center is always at a fixed distance from the head and it rotates along with the described object,<br/>
there is not a chance for two of them to overlap in 100% (it is though possible with axis-aligned rectangular bars).<br/>
Unless, of course, the characters' bodies get stuck in each other, which would count as a glitch already.
<br/>
<br/>
Let me now summarize most of the changes via the two following clips.<br/>
Shooting characters in slow motion:<br/>

<br/>
Killing them (the last murder in slow motion, too):<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
All new features in detail:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vsenum">1.</span> The circular HUD: <br/>
<span class="vsenum">1.1.</span> Informs you about: current <span class="vskeyword">health value</span>, current ammo values (only the controlled entity), nickname (currently, just placeholders) of a <span class="vstype">sentient object</span>.<br/>
<span class="vsenum">1.2.</span> For the entity that I control, rotations of relevant bars follow the angle of my head; for each remaining object, HUD's rotation is dependent upon my relative position thereto.<br/>
<span class="vsenum">1.3.</span> Saturation of each bar smoothly transitions to red or violet, with accordance to the ratio of the current to maximum value thereof.<br/>
<span class="vsenum">1.4.</span> When the entity is rather low on <span class="vskeyword">health</span>, the whole HUD noticeably pulsates, also a subtle red border becomes visible.<br/>
<span class="vsenum">2.</span> Improvement of damage response: <br/>
<span class="vsenum">2.1.</span> HUD temporarily highlights the damaged entity in pure red; pure green if it is being healed.<br/>
<span class="vsenum">2.2.</span> In the point of impact, spawned is a number that indicates change to the <span class="vskeyword">health value</span>; it flies vertically towards its disappearance.<br/> 
<span class="vsenum">3.</span> Test green charges are used to heal <span class="vstype">sentient beings</span>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="{{ site.img_dir }}13.Green-charge.png"/><br/>
<br/>

<span class="vsenum">4.</span> Death prototype: when the <span class="vskeyword">health value</span> drops to zero, the affected <span class="vstype">sentient entity</span> loses its physical aspect and a corpse (a mere dynamic body) is spawned in its place. RIP.<br/>
<span class="vsenum">5.</span> Crosshair displacement: <br/>
<span class="vsenum">5.1.</span> Recoil now imposes angular displacement instead of a linear one.<br/>
This fixes the inconsistency between spray patterns when the crosshair is near the barrel <span class="vsparam">(the gun goes crazy - "panika celownika")</span> and when it is very far away <span class="vsparam">(hardly any change in gunshots' direction)</span>.<br/>
<span class="vsenum">5.2.</span> <span class="vstype">Sentient beings</span> get aimpunched upon receiving damage or when an item they're holding is hit by a bullet.<br/>
<br/>
Notes on the circular bars of HUD:<br/>
<br/> 
<span class="vsenum">They are generated procedurally <span class="vsparam"> (using midpoint circle algorithm)</span>.</span><br/>As such, I'm able to instantly resize them and add borders/colors however I please without touching the graphics editor.<br/>They'll probably be smaller for things like vehicle parts' healths.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="vsenum">They are rendered with a special-purpose angle-cutoff shader, instead of rotated.</span><br/>
This notably improves their quality, especially since they are meant to accompany pixel-artish figures.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
That's it for today.<br/>
I will soon revisit the world of <span class="vskeyword">AI</span> to have some worthy enemies already!<span/>
