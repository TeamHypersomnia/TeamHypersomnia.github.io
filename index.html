  <span class="vscomment">// Summary
</span> <br/><br/>

    <span class="vstype">Hypersomnia</span> is an upcoming 2D multiplayer <span class="vstype">futuristic</span> universe with elements of <span class="vskeyword">fast-paced shooter</span>, <span class="vskeyword"> stealth </span> and <span class="vskeyword">role-playing game</span>. 
    <br/>Set in a hypothetical afterlife reality, it is meant to provide joy through altruistic behaviours and fulfillment of elaborate social roles, including, but not limited to, sowing panic as a traitor to benevolent ones. <br/><br/> The project is being brought to life with mere forces of a single man; <br/>
    he holds the project in his highest esteem and is well aware it will necessarily take months of intense, wholehearted labour. <br/>
    <br/>
    As of currently, the project takes advantage of the following technologies:<br/>
    * <span class="vsenum">C++</span><br/>
    * <span class="vsenum">OpenGL</span><br/>
    * <span class="vsenum">Box2D</span> <span class="vscomment">  // physics simulation engine</span><br/>
    * <span class="vsenum">Lua with Luabind</span><span class="vscomment">  // mostly configuration</span><br/>
    * <span class="vsenum">RakNet</span><span class="vscomment">  // networking engine </span><br/>
    * <span class="vsenum">polypartition</span><span class="vscomment"> // polygon partitioning library </span><br/>
    * <span class="vsenum">FreeType</span><span class="vscomment">  // text rendering </span><br/>
    <br/>
    The rest being the craftsmanship of the author.
    
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There is yet no official lore apart from a huge Game Design Document whose assumptions are being slowly, yet steadily, fulfilled.<br/>
    The stories will be written down when all else is done.<br/>

<br/>

  I am an independent developer with a lifelong interest in study and practice of engineering simulations. <br/>
  I was born in <span class="vsnumber">1995</span>, involved myself deeply in programming by <span class="vsnumber">2008</span> and have been enamoured with this activity ever since.<br/><br/>

  You can find me on <a class="vsenum" href="http://stackexchange.com/users/236344/devdalus?tab=accounts">StackExchange</a> and all my former projects here on <a class="vsenum" href="https://github.com/geneotech/">GitHub</a>. 
  <br/>Or just contact me via <a class="vsenum" href="mailto:patryk.czachurski@gmail.com">e-mail</a>.
<br/><br/>
  I envision a server populated with players of my game,<br/>a warm processing unit that continuously propagates schemata I've designed;<br/>
  an entropic entity that tirelessly exchanges state of my macrocosm with hundreds of individuals across the whole world, whilst scattering cyan neons across the dark bedroom.<br/><br/>
  When I fall asleep with this machine placed under my pillow, listening to the heartbeat of my universe, my life will be complete.<br/>

  If you wish to contribute to development of Hypersomnia, you are free to fork <a class="vsenum" href="https://github.com/geneotech/Augmentations">Augmentations</a> (the codebase) and <a class="vsenum" href="https://github.com/geneotech/Hypersomnia">Hypersomnia</a> (mostly assets and configs).<br/>
  I currently do not distribute up-to-date executables, but it is trivial to build and launch the current version using instructions <a class="vsenum" href="https://github.com/geneotech/Augmentations/blob/master/build_instructions.txt">here</a>.
<br/>
<br/>

If you dream about creating an entirely new mechanic, I recommend that you be familiar with <a class ="vsenum" href="http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/31473/what-is-the-role-of-systems-in-a-component-based-entity-
architecture">component-based entity architecture</a> beforehand.<br/> Better yet, tell me about your plans! Together we can deal with the problems more swiftly.

<br/>
<br/>
In any case, I am sure to consider every pull request.

<br/>
<br/>
  Or if you just can't wait to utter some brilliant suggestions regarding the game or the website, please do so, too!
