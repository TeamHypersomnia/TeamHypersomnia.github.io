</span> <br/><br/>

    <span class="vstype">Hypersomnia</span> is an upcoming 2D multiplayer <span class="vstype">futuristic</span> universe with elements of <span class="vskeyword">fast-paced shooter</span>, <span class="vskeyword"> stealth </span> and <span class="vskeyword">role-playing game</span>. 
    <br/>Set in a hypothetical afterlife reality, it is meant to provide joy through altruistic behaviours and fulfillment of elaborate social roles,<br/>including, but not limited to, sowing panic as a traitor to benevolent ones. <br/><br/>
    Decide upon your allegiance to one of the three warring factions, <span class="vstype">Metropolis</span>, <span class="vstype">Atlantis</span> and <span class="vstype">Resistance</span> whose apple of discord is
    a strong disagreement on what constitues <span class="vsmacro">moral excellence</span>.<br/>

    <br/>The project is being brought to life with mere forces of a single man; <br/>
    he holds the project in his highest esteem and is well aware it will necessarily take months of intense, wholehearted labour. <br/>

  <span class="vscomment">// Progress</span><br/><br/>

  The purpose of this website is to portray state-of-the-art through <a class="vsenum">in-game pictures</a> and most importantly, <a class="vsenum">blog posts</a>.<br/>
  Be sure to follow both - I will not keep any official list with current features for it is bound to outdate in a matter of days.<br/>

    <br/>
    There is yet no official <span class="vskeyword">lore</span> or <span class="vskeyword">wiki</span> apart from a huge <span class="vstype">Game Design Document</span> whose assumptions are being slowly, yet steadily, fulfilled.<br/>
    The stories written are many, yet they will be polished and revealed when all else is complete.<br/>

  <span class="vscomment">// Why some of the formerly seen features are absent in the current version? Is the project tending in a backward direction?</span><br/><br/>
  By all means, no:<br/>
  <a class="vstype">Hypersomnia is currently undergoing a major rewrite.</a><br/>

  <br/>
  The act of writing things anew is a common practice in the world of game development.<br/>
  This time however is sure to be the last, and whatever you see in the latest screenshots will nevermore disappear in the future versions, unless replaced with something better.<br/>
  <br/>
  <span class="vsparam">(The game has an already playable <a class="vsenum" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z622YeKcv9k">singleplayer version</a> with nasty enemy AI,<br/>
  it however was a dirty prototype and needed a great deal of rewriting for multiplayer over the network.<br/> In the meantime I've worked on pixel-art lighting and 
  now I have a working server which lets several people connect, pick a gun or an axe into their inventory and shoot each other in a pixely cathedral.<br/>
  Unfortunately, it is mostly scripted - the game becomes unplayable with just four people shooting at the same time.<br/>
  Due to that, Hypersomnia is being rewritten into a high-performance language which will hopefully let me handle hundreds of players in real-time.)<br/><br/>

  <span class="vscomment" id="TECHNICALITIES">// Technicalities </span>
    <br/>

    <br/>
    As of currently, the project takes advantage of the following technologies:<br/>
    * <span class="vsenum">C++</span><br/>
    * <a href="https://www.opengl.org/" class="vsenum">OpenGL</a><br/>
    * <a href="https://www.box2d.org/" class="vsenum">Box2D</a> <span class="vscomment">  // physics simulation engine</span><br/>
    * <a href="http://www.rasterbar.com/products/luabind.html" class="vsenum">Lua with Luabind</a><span class="vscomment">  // mostly configuration</span><br/>
    * <a href="http://www.jenkinssoftware.com/" class="vsenum">RakNet</a><span class="vscomment">  // networking engine </span><br/>
    * <a href="https://github.com/ivanfratric/polypartition" class="vsenum">polypartition</a><span class="vscomment"> // polygon partitioning library </span><br/>
    * <a href="https://www.freetype.org/" class="vsenum">FreeType</a><span class="vscomment">  // text rendering </span><br/>
    <br/>
    The rest being the craftsmanship of the author.

  I currently do not distribute up-to-date executables, but it is trivial to build and launch the current version using <span class="vsstring">instructions</span> <a class="vsenum" href="https://github.com/geneotech/Augmentations/blob/master/build_instructions.txt">here</a>.

If you dream about creating an entirely new mechanic, I recommend that you be familiar with <a class ="vsenum" href="http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/31473/what-is-the-role-of-systems-in-a-component-based-entity-
architecture">component-based entity architecture</a> beforehand.<br/> Better yet, tell me about your plans! Together we can deal with problems more swiftly.

<br/>
<br/>
In any case, I am sure to consider every <span class="vstype">pull request</span>.

  I envision a server populated with players of my game, a warm processing unit that continuously propagates schemata I've designed;<br/>
