<span class="subjectheader">About me</span><br/><br/>

 I am an independent developer with a lifelong interest in study and practice of programming. <br/>
  I was born in <span class="vsnumber">1995</span>.<br/>
  In <span class="vsnumber">2008</span>, I involved myself deeply in the art of manufacturing games - being an audiovisual immersion, both joyful and sublime,<br/>
  they are a perfect retreat from the diseases of our mad universe.<br/><br/>

I am currently working full-time on Hypersomnia and will continue to do so regardless of hardships to come.<br/>
This project is the manifestation of my love for all games considered oldschool, especially ones that reward devotion.<br/>
My dream is to create a vast, storytelling universe, and therein gather numerous men exclusively to my liking,<br/>
with whom we would engage into this immaterial world to play our roles. <br/>
<br/>
I want my men to be nostalgic about my game even before its greatness becomes but a tale of some distant past.<br/>
<br/>

<span class="vsparam">
  I envision a server populated with players of my game, a warm processing unit that continuously propagates schemata I've designed;<br/>
  an entropic entity that tirelessly exchanges state of my macrocosm with hundreds of individuals across the planet, whilst scattering <span class="vstype">cyan neons</span> across the dark bedroom.<br/><br/>
  When I place this machine under my pillow and fall asleep while listening to the heartbeat of my universe, my life will be complete.<br/>
