<span class="subjectheader">About me</span><br/><br/>

 I am an independent developer with a lifelong interest in study and practice of engineering simulations. <br/>
  I was born in <span class="vsnumber">1995</span>, involved myself deeply in programming by <span class="vsnumber">2008</span> and have been enamoured with this activity ever since.<br/><br/>

I am currently working full-time on Hypersomnia and will continue to do so regardless of hardships to come.<br/>
This project is the manifestation of my love for all games considered old school, especially ones that reward devotion.<br/>
When I was a kid, I met some of my best buddies through game communities; I have always therefore wished to once found my own, one with a lot of amazing people,<br/>
and I want them to be nostalgic about my game even before its greatness becomes but a tale of some distant past.<br/>
<br/>

<span class="vsparam">
  I envision a server populated with players of my game, a warm processing unit that continuously propagates schemata I've designed;<br/>
  an entropic entity that tirelessly exchanges state of my macrocosm with hundreds of individuals across the planet, whilst scattering <span class="vstype">cyan neons</span> across the dark bedroom.<br/><br/>
  When I place this machine under my pillow and fall asleep while listening to the heartbeat of my universe, my life will be complete.<br/>
