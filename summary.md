  <span style="font-size:21px">Summary</span>
</span> <br/><br/>

    <span class="vstype">Hypersomnia</span> is an upcoming 2D multiplayer <span class="vstype">futuristic</span> universe with elements of <span class="vskeyword">fast-paced shooter</span>, <span class="vskeyword"> stealth </span> and <span class="vskeyword">role-playing game</span>. 
    <br/>Set in a hypothetical afterlife reality, it is meant to provide joy through altruistic behaviours and fulfillment of elaborate social roles,<br/>including, but not limited to, sowing panic as a traitor to benevolent ones. <br/><br/>
    Decide upon your allegiance to one of the three warring factions whose apple of discord is
    a strong disagreement on what constitues <span class="vsmacro">moral excellence</span>.<br/>
 <span class="vstype">Metropolis</span>; <span class="vstype">Atlantis</span>; <span class="vstype">Resistance.</span><br/>

    <br/>The project is being brought to life with mere forces of a single man; <br/>
    he holds the project in his highest esteem and is well aware it will necessarily take months of intense, wholehearted labour. <br/>

  The purpose of this website is to portray state-of-the-art through <a class="vsenum" href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B_gBQSJQBKcjTzJ2bDVhWDhxSjQ&usp=sharing">in-game pictures</a> and most importantly, <a class="vsenum" href="{{site.url}}">blog posts</a>.<br/>
  Be sure to follow both - I will not keep any official list with current features for it is bound to outdate in a matter of days.<br/>

    <br/>
    There is yet no official <span class="vskeyword">lore</span> or <span class="vskeyword">wiki</span> apart from a huge <span class="vstype">Game Design Document</span> whose assumptions are being slowly, yet steadily, fulfilled.<br/>
    The stories written are many, yet they will be polished and revealed when all else is complete.<br/>

  <span class="vscomment">// Why some of the formerly seen features are absent in the current version? Is the project tending in a backward direction?</span><br/><br/>
  By all means, no:<br/>
  <a class="vstype">Hypersomnia is currently undergoing a major rewrite.</a><br/>

  <br/>
  The act of writing things anew is a common practice in the world of game development.<br/>
  This time however is sure to be the last, and whatever you see in the latest screenshots will nevermore disappear in the future versions, unless replaced with something better.<br/>
  <br/>
  <span class="vsparam">(The game has an already playable <a class="vsenum" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z622YeKcv9k">singleplayer version</a> with nasty enemy AI,<br/>
  it is however a dirty prototype; as such, it needed a great deal of polish for multiplayer over the network.<br/> 
  <br/>Eventually I rewrote it and worked on pixel-art lighting in the meantime; <br/>as a result, I have a working server which lets several people connect, pick a gun or an axe into their inventory and shoot each other in a pixely cathedral.<br/>
  Unfortunately, it is mostly scripted - framerate drops with just four people shooting at the same time and the game becomes unplayable.<br/>
  Due to that, Hypersomnia is being rewritten into a high-performance language which will hopefully let me handle hundreds of players in real-time.)<br/><br/>

    * <a href="https://www.box2d.org/" class="vsenum">Box2D</a> <span class="vscomment">  // physics simulation engine</span><br/>
    * <a href="http://www.rasterbar.com/products/luabind.html" class="vsenum">Lua with Luabind</a><span class="vscomment">  // mostly configuration</span><br/>
    * <a href="http://www.jenkinssoftware.com/" class="vsenum">RakNet</a><span class="vscomment">  // networking engine </span><br/>
