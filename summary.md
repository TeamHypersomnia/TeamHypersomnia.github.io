    <span class="vstype">Hypersomnia</span> is an upcoming 2D multiplayer <span class="vstype">futuristic</span> universe with elements of <span class="vskeyword">fast-paced shooter</span>, <span class="vskeyword"> stealth </span> and <span class="vskeyword">role-playing game</span>. 
    <br/>Set in a hypothetical afterlife reality, it is meant to provide joy through altruistic behaviours and fulfillment of elaborate social roles,<br/>including, but not limited to, sowing panic as a traitor to benevolent ones. <br/><br/>
    Decide upon your allegiance to one of the three warring factions whose apple of discord is
    a disparity between prevailing notions of <span class="vsmacro">moral excellence</span>.<br/>
 <span class="vstype">Metropolis</span>; <span class="vstype">Atlantis</span>; <span class="vstype">Resistance.</span><br/>

    <br/>The project is being brought to life with mere forces of a single man; <br/>
    he holds the project in his highest esteem and is well aware it will necessarily take months of intense, wholehearted labour. <br/>

  I will not keep any official list with current features for it is bound to outdate in a matter of days.<br/>
  The purpose of this website is to portray state-of-the-art through <a class="vsenum" href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B_gBQSJQBKcjTzJ2bDVhWDhxSjQ&usp=sharing">in-game pictures</a> and most importantly, <a class="vsenum" href="{{site.url}}">blog posts</a>.
  
<br/>
    <br/>
    There is yet no official <span class="vskeyword">lore</span> or <span class="vskeyword">wiki</span> apart from a huge <span class="vstype">Game Design Document</span> whose assumptions are being slowly, yet steadily, fulfilled.<br/>
    The stories written are many, but they will be polished and revealed when all else is complete. Stay tuned!<br/>

  <span class="vscomment" id="TECHNICALITIES">// Technicalities </span>
    <br/>

    <br/>
    As of currently, the project takes advantage of the following technologies:<br/>
    * <span class="vsenum">C++</span><br/>
    * <a href="https://www.opengl.org/" class="vsenum">OpenGL</a><br/>
    * <a href="https://www.box2d.org/" class="vsenum">Box2D</a> <span class="vscomment">  // physics simulation engine</span><br/>
    * <a href="http://www.rasterbar.com/products/luabind.html" class="vsenum">Lua with Luabind</a><span class="vscomment">  // mostly configuration</span><br/>
    * <a href="http://www.jenkinssoftware.com/" class="vsenum">RakNet</a><span class="vscomment">  // networking engine </span><br/>
    * <a href="https://github.com/ivanfratric/polypartition" class="vsenum">polypartition</a><span class="vscomment"> // polygon partitioning library </span><br/>
    * <a href="https://www.freetype.org/" class="vsenum">FreeType</a><span class="vscomment">  // font glyph rendering </span><br/>
    <br/>
    The rest being the craftsmanship of the author.<br/>
    <br/>
I am currently in the process of rewriting some of the major features from <span class="vstype">Lua</span> into <span class="vstype">C++</span>,<br/>most notably working multiplayer server (can connect with 3-4 players and shoot each other), pixel-art lighting and enemy AI.<br/>
This is necessary as I want to be able to handle tens or maybe hundreds of simultaneous players easily.<br/>
